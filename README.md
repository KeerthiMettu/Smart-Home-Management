##Smart Home Management

This is a project that describes the creation and stages of development of a Smart House Management using Arduino Uno board. The project consists of five main modules, which includes a combination of safety measures and entertainment aspects for the users of the system.
The modules in the system are:

Intruder detection
Fire detection
Music system for authenticated users
Display of the room environment conditions
Display on the LCD screen and glowing of the light in different colors according to each of the working module.
 
The first two modules are designed to alert the people in the house. This is done through an alarm, when a person enters the house or in case of a fire break out in the surroundings of the house, an alarm is triggered. The ultrasonic sensor is used for the intruder detection and the flame sensor is used for the fire detection module. To play the music, the user has the choice of selecting a song with the operation of the remote control, only if he/she gets authenticated through the fingerprint match process on a Touch sensor. Alongside, appropriate messages are displayed on the LCD screen and the RGB LED that indicates different colours for different sensor functioning in the system. There is also a provision for authenticated users to switch on or off, the RBG LED as per the need. When these key sensors donâ€™t have any significant information to show on the LCD screen, DTH11 sensor shows the temperature and humidity of the room, where it is placed.
